## Overview

Hi there! I'm a Module 1 Front-End student at the Turing School of Software and Design. Tic-Tac-Toe was the capstone project to end our first 6 weeks of learning how to code in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. The idea of building out the game from scratch was daunting at first, but one that also excited me--I couldn't wait to show off everything I had learned over the past 6 weeks.

## Goals

The project's goals, listed below in an abbreviated form, are taken directly from the Turing project write-up:

``` Markdown
- Solidify and demonstrate understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - localStorage to persist data
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
- Use problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step
```

Some personal goals that I also wanted to include:
- Implement as much of the project as possible
- Use good git-based workflow with consistent use of PR templates
- Build all the basic functionality, and attempt some stretch goals like:
  - Extra features beyond the project spec
  - Extra styling
  - CSS animations
